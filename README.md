# This is a collection of scripts I wrote in Python in order to automate tedious tasks in Wizard101, like farming certain bosses or farming certain resources 
# Fundamentally consists of scanning the screen and pixel-matching by means of the pyautogui library and then clicking on certain locations on the screen 
# What I learned most from this is the process of trouble-shooting and debugging the script, and ensuring that the logic with which the script is written is sound
# In order to account for any random variable or extraneous factor in the game, especially with my intention to simply leave the script running for hours without checking,
# the logic of the script had to be very robust and wide-reaching.
