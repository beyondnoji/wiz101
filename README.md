# This is a collection of scripts I wrote in Python in order to automate tedious tasks in Wizard101, like farming certain bosses or farming certain resources. Fundamentally consists of scanning the screen and pixel-matching by means of the pyautogui library and then clicking on certain locations on the screen. 
What I learned most from this project is the process of trouble-shooting and debugging the script, and ensuring that the logic was good so that I could genuinely leave the program running for hours without worrying about it or checking on it. I set in place certain fail-safe mechanisms so that, even if something had gone wrong, the script would in time correct itself. All in all, I learnt a lot and I think this made my programming skills as well as my problem-solving skills better, and I feel that I became more resillient and understanding of the process involved in creating programs with more complicated goals.
