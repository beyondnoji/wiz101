# This is a collection of scripts I wrote in Python in order to automate tedious tasks in Wizard101 (a MMORPG), like farming certain bosses or farming certain resources. See "EmpowerScript.py", "RaFarmer.py", "JadeOni.py" for greater detail. 
# It fundamentally consists of scanning the screen and pixel-matching by means of the pyautogui library and then clicking on certain locations on the screen according to logic dictated within a while-loop. I made a class Player which had methods associated with three general phases of the script (running to the boss, the boss encounter, running away and starting again). This compartmentalization of the script aided tremendously and made it so that I could write a variety of scripts for any number of bosses as opposed to hard-coding it for one single boss encounter/purpose.
# What I learned most from this project is the process of trouble-shooting and debugging the script, and ensuring that the logic was good so that I could genuinely leave the program running for hours without worrying about it or checking on it. I set in place certain fail-safe mechanisms so that, even if something had gone wrong, the script would in time correct itself. All in all, I learnt a lot and I think this made my programming skills as well as my problem-solving skills better, and I feel that I became more resillient and understanding of the process involved in creating programs with more complicated goals.
